      </h3>
      <div class="RAMexpandedContent"><strong>How do I pay? </strong>Pay the instructor with cash, credit or a check (made out to Flight Risk Aerials) when you arrive. If you prefer to pre-pay please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Do you require a deposit?</strong> Yes, we do require a deposit in order to book an instructor for your party. You can go to <a href="http://www.wellnessonthegreen.com/parties-deposit.html">http://www.wellnessonthegreen.com/parties-deposit.html</a> to pay for the $100 deposit and read our terms &amp; conditions.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Do you need a head count beforehand?</strong> We don't need a head count beforehand... And there's no min or max number of people required, just the minimum price of $200 if you have less than 8 people. For large groups, keep in mind that we have 7 poles and we recommend 14 or 21 (or less) as an ideal number. For aerial silks, we have 13 so 13 people is a good number. It's really up to you though!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>One of our guests is pregnant, elderly or unable to take the class. Do they have to pay? </strong> No. If a person doesn't participate they don't have to pay.</div>

      </h3>
      <div class="RAMexpandedContent"><strong>Bellydance:</strong> Wear yoga or stretchy pants that allow free movement - no jeans! - and a shirt or tank top that is not too loose (we want to be able to see your movements). You can wear a cropped top and bare your stomach if you choose, but most students do not. You can dance barefoot or with socks. Most students also wear coin belts or hip scarves, which are available to buy or borrow at class. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Pole Dance:</strong> Comfortable workout clothing is advisable. For more intermediate moves, please wear shorts. Heels or sneakers are not allowed - most students pole dance barefoot, with socks or soft soled shoes. All lotion must be removed from all body parts before class as it ruins the poles for other students and instructors. All jewelry must be removed before class as it will damage our equipment and your jewelery will also get damaged. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Aerial Silks & Aerial Hoop (Lyra):</strong> Leggings, tights or stretchy pants that fit closely around the ankles are best along with a tight fitted T shirt, tank top or leotard. Bare feet. All jewelry must be removed before class as it will damage our equipment and your jewelery will also get damaged. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Chair Dance:</strong> Wear yoga or stretchy pants that allow free movement - no jeans! - and a shirt or tank top. Most students dance barefoot.</div>

      </h3>
      <div class="RAMexpandedContent"><strong> One of our guests is pregnant. Can she still take the class? </strong> It depends on the type of class you choose. Bellydance is an excellent choice for pregnant women. We do not recommend they participate in aerial silks or lyra. For pole dance, many of the moves are fine for pregnant women, but we don't recommend any move that requires them to hold their weight off the floor such as spins or inverts. Chair dance and Burlesque is also a good choice. The instructor can tailor the class to suit your needs upon request. </div>

      </h3>
      <div class="RAMexpandedContent"><strong>I'm under 18 - can I still attend your classes?</strong> There's no minimum age - but if you're under 18 then you'll need a parent/guardian to sign a waiver the first time if you wish to attend aerial silks, lyra or pole dance classes. Your parent/guardian can sign it when you get there, or <a href="http://www.wellnessonthegreen.com/waiver.pdf" target="_blank">click here to download our waiver</a> and bring it with you!<br>
        <br>
        <strong>My kids want to try your silks/pole class. Is that ok? </strong> There's no age minimum, but for younger kids (under 13) we require a parent to take the first class along with them to be sure they are ok and help them if needed. If that's cool then feel free to drop into any of our classes at any time!</div>
