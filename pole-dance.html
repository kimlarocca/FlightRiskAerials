      </div>
      <p class="margin40">For first time pole dancers, super beginners and those who want to start getting in shape or just have fun! In our Intro To Pole Dance class students will learn the fundamentals of pole dancing including walks, beginner spins, transitions and basic dance moves. Moves are broken down and students are given plenty of time to learn and perfect them. We recommend taking this class at least a few times before moving on to Level 1. Attire: Sports bra, tank top or t shirt with shorts or comfortable workout pants. Please wear shorts (booty shorts if possible)! This class dances barefoot. All lotion on your body MUST be washed off prior to class, and jewelry on your hands, fingers, wrists, toes and ankles is not allowed.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="margin40">We recommend you an intro class (or have taken pole dance at another studio) a few times before joining this class. Perfect all the spins (view the video above in which our instructor  demonstrates some beginner spins that you will learn in class). Learn floorwork, transitions, combinations and routines. Learn how to climb the pole, execute pole tricks and do basic inverts. This class also incorporates some strength training and flexibility exercises. Attire: Sports bra, tank top or t shirt. Shorts are required, booty shorts are preferable (you will need your upper inner thigh skin to be exposed). Most students dance barefoot. All lotion on your body MUST be washed off prior to class, and jewelry on your hands, fingers, wrists, toes and ankles is not allowed.</p>

      </div>
      <p class="margin40">This class is for intermediate and advanced students only. An interested student MUST speak to the instructor of the class before joining. Ready to try more advanced moves? Go beyond the basic invert and learn more advanced combinations, routines &amp; tricks. Students should be comfortable with climbing the pole and doing the basic invert before taking this class. Attire: Sports bra or tank top. Shorts are required. Booty shorts with a sports bra is preferable but not required (you will need your upper inner thigh skin to be exposed, and it helps to have your waist/stomach skin exposed as well). Most students dance barefoot. All lotion on your body MUST be washed off prior to class, and jewelry on your hands, fingers, wrists, toes and ankles is not allowed.</p>

      <h4>What To Wear To Pole Dance Classes</h4>
      <p><strong>Be sure to thoroughly clean your hands, arms and legs before class to get rid of any lotion or lotion residue that may be on there!!!</strong> Please be considerate of others. Having lotion on will not only make your pole too slippery to hold but will ruin the pole for anyone else who may use it after you. Please do not wear any bracelets, watches or rings and they will get scratched and will scratch our poles. Jewelry on your hands, fingers, wrists, toes and ankles is not allowed. Comfortable workout clothing is advisable. Wear shorts (booty shorts) if possible. Shorts are required for non-intro classes. Heels are not recommended - most students dance barefoot - and heels are not allowed in the intro classes. Some instructors use yoga mats. You may bring your own yoga mat, and bring your own towel &amp; rubbing alcohol to clean the poles with if you prefer. Yoga mats are also available to borrow.</p>
