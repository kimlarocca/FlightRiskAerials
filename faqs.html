      <div class="RAMexpandedContent"><strong>Bellydance</strong>: Wear yoga or stretchy pants that allow free movement - no jeans! - and a shirt or tank top that is not too loose (we want to be able to see your movements). You can wear a cropped top and bare your stomach if you choose, but most students do not. You can dance barefoot or with socks. Most students also wear coin belts or hip scarves, which are available to buy or borrow at class. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pole Dance</strong>: Comfortable workout clothing is advisable. For more intermediate moves, please wear shorts. Heels or sneakers are not allowed - most students pole dance barefoot, with socks or soft soled shoes. <u>All lotion must be removed from all body parts before class</u> as it ruins the poles for other students and instructors. All jewelry must be removed before class as it will damage our equipment and your jewelery will also get damaged. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Aerial Silks &amp; Aerial Hoop (Lyra)</strong>: Leggings, tights or stretchy pants that fit closely around the ankles are best along with a tight fitted T shirt, tank top or leotard. Bare feet. All jewelry must be removed before class as it will damage our equipment and your jewelery will also get damaged.</div>
