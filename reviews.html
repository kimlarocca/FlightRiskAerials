    <h2>So fun you have no idea you are working out!</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>I have attended almost every class here at Flight Risk Aerials for about four months. They have high energy pole classes, exciting aerial silk classes, and dynamic Lyra classes. From the moment you walk up the stairs and into the studio you will be comfortable and welcomed - something that is so hard to find in today's &quot;we are just in it for the money&quot; world. The staff truly enjoys providing top notch hospitality to people of ALL skill levels and if you have any questions they are always more then happy to provide help and spotting. Flight Risk Aerials has a variety of classes ranging from beginner to advanced to suit the needs of all who come to class. Lastly, and most importantly - The classes are so fun you have no idea you are working out!!!<br />

      Absolute first class operation.</p>

  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>I have been going to pole, lyra, and aerial silks classes for about a month. From the first class i was hooked. The instructors all have their own teaching style and are invested in helping students progress throughout class. Warm -ups have increased my flexibility closer to that which i had in collegiate sports. The prices are fair especially when you check out what other places charge and the abundance of class styles you can choose from. <br />
      <br />
      I highly recommend Flight Risk Aerials</p>

    <p>What an amazing birthday party for our Bella, Aerial Silks class. Julie was amazing, patient, fun, encouraging and made the whole experience fun for the girls. It's so nice to share new experiences with friends and their kids. <br />
      <br />
      Thank you for a great evening. Made our Bella's 10th birthday amazing and memorable.</p>

    <h2>I've lost almost 15 lbs...</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>Just 3 months ago I started Lyra classes on a whim, and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made. I've lost almost 15 lbs and am stronger than I was even during the rugby seasons. It's done wonders for my confidence, especially after a tough few months, and I've made awesome new friends in the process.<br />
      If you ever have the opportunity to learn lyra, or the aerial silks, DO IT. Sometimes if life gets too hard on the ground you need to start to fly.</p>

  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>Had so much fun in class, all the teachers are so nice and helpful and I learned a lot of things I didn't know how to do. Watching the more advanced students do tricks and moves was amazing. I'd recommend everyone to try this at least once guy or girl.</p>

    <h2>The prices are over 35 % lower than those in NY.</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>I can't wait for my school year to be done so I am free to drive the hour to these classes. I'm coming from Queens NY.  The prices are over 35 % lower than those in NY.  If you would like to pay 75 dollars for a drop in rate, by all means take a train into the city.... but in the interim, you might want to do your research before trashing someones business because you think you $20 dollars is to expensive. I will gladly pay that and tolls!!!
      See you in a few weeks</p>

    <h2>The instructors there are very patient, respectful and good at what they do...</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>I went to this place with a group of girls for a private Aerial Silks class about a year or so ago - the price for a private rental was extremely fair. The communication with staff was very good as Kim always answers my emails promptly and efficiently. I would honestly take classes more often if I didn't work or live more than 30 mins away - the instructors there are very patient, respectful and good at what they do. For those complaining it is too expensive, where else do you find a studio in the area that offers these kinds of classes? These are unique classes especially aerial silks and lyra where in the city they charge over $30. Can't wait to try out either the sampler class or hopefully book another event soon!</p>

    <div>
      <p>I have to be honest, I've only been there for one class so far. I found their class schedule online and have only taken the intro/level 1 pole class. But I felt extremely comfortable and had a great time at the class. My instructor was jasmine and she went at a pace that I as a beginner and other people who have already taken many classes enjoyed and were able to not only keep up but learn new material. She was fun and easy going as were the girls who helped me sign in. I felt very welcome and have signed up for a package of 8 classes. Looking forward to more classes here!</p>

    <h2>Can't express how much i love it =)</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="content left margin0">
    <p>Love it!!! As a bigger girl, i never thought i would be able to do anything like aerial silks. You always see these unbelieavably nimble people dancing as they defy gravity. Hard to believe i was doing poses on silks on my first day! Half of the class was stretching and strength training. Both areas that need to develop to be a sucessful aerialist. Second half was the fun stuff. Once i was upside down on those silks, i was hooked! Studio was very clean, and the teacher was both helpful and understanding of different skill levels. Always found something new and fun that everyone in the class could keep up with.  Have been going weekly since that first class and have no thoughts of stopping. Class cards are a great deal as well. Can't express how much i love it =)<br />
      <br />
      P/S: I have a horrible back.  Chiropractor said core strengthening exercises would help.  Great core and arm workout! The difference is amazing!</p>
